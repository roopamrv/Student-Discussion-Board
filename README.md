# CSE5333-Student-Discussion-Board
A student's discussion board is a social media platform where UTA (University of Texas at
Arlington) students can post "discussions" about their coursework or school events. In addition,
users can comment and react to questions. The main goal of this application is to impart
information or offer answers to users' questions. Additionally, if the program already knows the
answer to the user's requests, it will automatically respond.
